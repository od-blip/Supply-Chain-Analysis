## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to analyze a supply chain dataset to gain insights into sales, demand, shipment, customer behavior, and product performance. This analysis helps businesses make data-driven decisions to optimize operations and enhance profitability.  

---

## Data Sources
**CSV files from Kaggle.**  

---

## Tools Used
- **Python**: For data cleaning, preparation, and preprocessing.  
- **Power BI**: For further cleaning, building relationships, modeling, and creating visualizations.  
- **ChatGPT**: For assistance with insights, documentation, and report formatting.  

---

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
- **Python**: 
  - Preprocessing involved renaming columns, removing duplicates, and eliminating empty rows.  
  - The dataset was split into 9 tables for easier analysis:
    - `fact_table`
    - `dim_order`
    - `dim_order_item`
    - `dim_customer`
    - `dim_product`
    - `dim_category`
    - `dim_department`
    - `dim_order_date`
    - `dim_shipping_date`  
  - Each table was exported as a CSV file for further processing.  

- **Power BI**:  
  - Additional cleaning was performed, such as renaming columns with snake_case to a more readable format.  
  - Relationships were modeled using a **snowflake schema**, linking fact and dimension tables.  
  - A new table called `Color Theme` was created to enable **dark/night mode switching**.
